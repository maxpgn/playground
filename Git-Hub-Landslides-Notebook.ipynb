    ">The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This is a unique data set with the ID tag “GLC” in the landslide editor.\n",

    "The file is made of more than 11,000 rows of 31 columns, each row being a landslide described with 31 characteristics. Let's perform easy investigation on it."

The mudslide was about 80 metres long and, according to Colin Saunders, the economic development officer for the hamlet, was the   biggest one on record for the hamlet. \"You could probably point your finger at global warming because the permafrost is slowing dying,\" said Saunders.  \"A lot of permafrost is actually just frozen mud and when it thaws, it slides.\"  Mike Richards, senior administrative officer for the hamlet, said he thinks the mudslide may have been due to a large amount of rain the area has been having lately.  \"The area is quite saturated,\" said Richards. There was a very fine clay that got saturated with water and seeped away, according to Richards, and a layer of gravel on top of it had eroded down, both of which caused the slide.  \n",

      " THE unusual downpour on Sunday wreaked havoc in several areas in Ampang with landslides and flash floods reported.  A landslide in the Riverdale Park Apartments (Block B) in Bukit Antarabangsa caused a scare with residents although there were no casualties or structural damage.  “Preliminary checks by MPAJ showed that the cause of the landslide was the result of surface run-off that flowed directly onto the surface of the slope.  “This situation was made worse by the absence of a cut-off drain on the surface of the slope to drain the runoff water. A wall located 3m below the slope had also given way,” she said. During the incident, a 25m landslide occurred at about 4pm after heavy rains. \n",
